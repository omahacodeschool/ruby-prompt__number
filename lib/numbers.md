# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

The different kinds of numbers in Ruby are Integers and Floats.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

Most of the common operations would be adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying numbers. 
There is also the option to find the remainder using modulus. 
You can do comparisons such as the equality comparison (i.e. 4 == 5 and it would come back as false)

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

The difference would be that if you use a '+' on a string it will add two strings together (i.e. 'apple' + 'pie' would make apple pie.
If used in the case of numbers it will add the numbers together.

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

It would not work properly. If done while trying to multiply it would simply write out "20" that many times (i.e. "20" * 5 = 2020202020)
To fix it you would have to remove the quotations around the 20 and simply have 20 * 5 for example.

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

The 'times' function is used in a loop and is not the same as '*'. It will not multiply two numbers together.
