# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

Ruby has 'Fixnum' numbers, or 'intigers' that are whole numbers, and a 'float' wich a non whole number with a decimel point.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

I suppose the most common operation with numbers would be in a mathmatical equation to complete a code.  It will be necessary to find out what type of 
number is being input by a user, and requesting that number be how the program needs it to be, like an integer or an even number

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

'+' when used with a string will help ruby to assign a value.  When its used with a number, it would simply add, or complete the mathmatical
equation.

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

No, it will not work becuase Ruby sees numbers in "" as the character, instead of the value.
If you but _String_ = 20 taking it out the the "" made it a value able to be used in a mathmatical operation

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

It is not the same as '*' as it can commit strings to keep replicated as many times or caluculated as many times as the user or the designer determines.
