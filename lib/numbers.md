# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

	The Two types of numbers used regularly are Fixnum (integer) and Float.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

	Some common comparison operators are ==,!=, <, >, >=, and <=. 

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

	With numbers the + sign will use math and add the values together while + sign to strings will combine two strings into one string. 

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

No, the string will need to be converted as an integer such as “20”.to_i

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

	The “times” operation is used for loops and the * is math operator for multiplication.
