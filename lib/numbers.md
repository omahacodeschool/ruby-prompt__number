is less than, is greater than, is less than or eaqual to, is greater than or equal to, is equal to, is not equal to are common comparions.

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

The '+' used with numbers is the addition operation.  2 + 2 => 4
The '+' used with strings connects the two together. "2" + "2" => 22

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

It will not work until you convert the string to either an integer to_i or to a float to_f.

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

Times and * are not the same.

The times opertion tells the program to do something a certain number of times.  
For example, you could repeat a word five times, or you could doulble a number 20 times. 

The * is the multiplication operation.
