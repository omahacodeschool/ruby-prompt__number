# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

In Ruby, numbers can be either integers or decimals. Numbers can also be processed as strings.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers, modulos (remainder when divided)

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

With numbers, + will add the values of the integers/decimals. With strings, + will put the two characters together in succession.

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

It won't work as a string, but it's possible to make it work with the command .to_i or .to_f

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

Replace me with your response...
The times operation is used to perform a task a specific amount of times. * is a mathematical operation to multiply two integers or decimals.
